                        </li>
                        <li>Hold an orientation meeting – An orientation meeting is held with partners for
                            familiarization purposes. This ensures that everyone is on the same level. The consultant
                            uses the time to agree on the approach, methodology and key activities</li>
                        <li>Document/literature review – conduct a document/literature review to gather more information
                            on partner’s donors, funds raised, type of funds, activities, plans, mission and vision. The
                            review provides information on the exact training needs.</li>

                            the challenges of the fundraising environment. Material is based on power point slides which

                        <li> Training – A timetable of the training indicating the time, activity and session taking
                            place is developed. This enables participants to plan their day

                        <li> Evaluation – An evaluation aimed at establishing if the training objectives have been
