                    <h1>Transfer Pricing Services</h1>
                    <img src="./images/pricing.jpg" alt="Tax Documents">
                    <p>In Kenya, transfer pricing is a relatively new but fast emerging field. Transfer pricing is a
                        complex subject and impacts every area of business – ranging from associated party purchases,
                        sales, financing instruments, loans, investments,marketing, distribution, use of tangible and
                        intangible assets, etc.. Multinationals are perceived to be potentially capable of shifting
                        their profits from high tax jurisdictions to low tax jurisdictions with the objective of
                        reducing global tax liability. On this premise the tax regulators view the international
                        transactions between associated enterprises with a lot of scepticism and are able to raise tax
                        issues which have huge tax ramifications.</p>
                        <p>Murey Yego & Associates tax team offer advisory services on transfer pricing documentation which
                        are regulatory compliant. Besides, we also render services in areas of transfer pricing study
                        and statutory reporting and representation before the transfer pricing officer
                        Businesses now find that their tax decisions are under close scrutiny, compared to years gone
                        by. Information sharing on various technological platforms has enhanced the efficiency of tax
                        authorities in the assessment of personal and corporate taxes, thereby increasing the potential
                        for unforeseen tax liabilities.</p>
                        <p>International businesses and conglomerates make numerous attempts to increase efficiencies in
                        operations, so as to maximize profits, and Revenue Authorities worldwide target such
                        corporations in relation to related-party transactions.
